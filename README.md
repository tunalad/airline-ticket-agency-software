# Airline ticket agency software
Teacher wanted us to make some software that utilizes a database, so I made this. Most of this project was doing the paper work, so this software is basically one night coding session (10th of June 2019 it says). Don't think I will be sharing that document.

### To-do list:
* fix a bug where database doesn't close when hitting X on "flights" page
* transalte the database and software to english
